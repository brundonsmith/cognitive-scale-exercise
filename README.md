Develop a web application which contains a page that allows the user to enter a string of characters. When the user submits the input, take each character and display a color to represent the character. So if the user submits "Hello World" they would see a series of 11 color shapes (1 for each character, including the space).

Additionally, keep track of the characters entered so far and allow a user to see the number of times each character was submitted to the system. This value is a cumulative total for all users, so it will add up as more and more users access this system.
